# Background

Ice Cream Dash is a Java-based game where you are tasked with filling an ice cream cone with specific toppings.
The menu display informs the player which toppings are needed to be stacked on the cone to complete the order.
With each incorrect topping that is stacked, the player loses a life. If the player loses all 3 possible lives,
the game is over. If they manage to stack all the necessary toppings within their 3 lives, they win the game!

# Development

Ice Cream Dash utilizes hitboxes whose sizes are calculated from the topping's size and the y-position of the cone.
Since each topping has a different size, there is one specific hitbox for each topping. 
Toppings are painted continuously using a falling function, which is set to False once there is an intersection 
with a hitbox. 

# How To Play

The objective of Ice Cream Dash is to catch the correct amount of toppings on the ice cream cone using the left
and right arrows on your keyboard. But be careful! Each incorrect topping you catch will
count as a mistake. 3 mistakes and you're out!
